Parent Control, a cloud-based time-series data management system with an Android client for phone usage tracking. The data management system contains two storage tiers, AWS EC2 and S3. Different pricing models of EC2 and S2 are used to build a caching system, including a time-related probabilistic online scheme and a deterministic scheme. The time-series data storage cost is optimized using the cache model.
